# Feedmail

Email was invented in 1971. We're still using the same protocol and inbox everyday.

Feedmail is trying a new take on email.

The goals of this project are:

- Validate ActivityPub as an alternative protocol
- Prevent spam by using the social graph
- Enable social network features

**This project is in early development.**
